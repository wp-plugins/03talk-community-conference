== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does 03TALK charge for hosting the service? =
We believe 03TALK is the best value telephone conference service available today. Each caller pays for his or her call to the 0330 330 0330 access number. There are no additional charges, unless you opt for one of our paid plans (coming soon) which offer advanced features such as conference call recording, recurring conferences, notification via SMS, Twitter, email and MSN and also allow larger numbers of callers to participate.
= What will I be charged for calling 0330 330 0330? =
Under Ofcom rules, calls to 03 numbers cost no more than those to regular landline numbers (01 or 02). Calls to 03 numbers must count towards any inclusive minutes offered by your fixed or mobile network operator in exactly the same way as 01 and 02 calls. These rules apply to calls from any type of line including mobile, BT, other fixed line or payphone. Go ahead! Dial in to an 03TALK conference from your mobile. There will be no nasty surprise when you receive your next bill.
= Do I need to visit 03TALK.com every time I want to set up a conference call? =
Your Conference Room and Access PIN are permanent so there's no need to revisit 03TALK unless you need to set up another room. If you need a new Conference Room quickly and don't have access to the Internet, you may also set up a call instantly simply by dialling 0330 330 0330 and selecting Option 2. You will be given your login details immediately and will be able to use them straight away.
= Can I use my 03TALK Conference Room more than once? =
Yes, you may dial in using the login details provided as many times as you like. These are unique to you and with a trillion permutations of Conference Room Number and Access PIN, they are also very secure. If you need to create additional Conference Rooms, simply visit 03TALK.com or dial 0330 330 0330 (Option 2) at any time.
= Do I need any specialist equipment? =
No, you can dial into an 03TALK conference from any touch-tone phone, mobile phone, landline phone, payphone and even using services such as SKYPE - in the same way that you would make a normal phone call.
= How many people can I invite to my conference call? =
Our free 03TALK service allows up to 20 callers to join a conference. Should you require access for more participants, please contact us to discuss our paid plans (coming soon).
= Do I need to set up the call in advance? =
No, you don't have to schedule your call in advance. Once your Conference Room Number and PIN have been created - using the One Click Set Up button on the right - simply dial 0330 330 0330 to begin conferencing. Your Conference Room Number and PIN are created instantly and will remain active permanently. If you need to create additional rooms, simply visit 03TALK.com or dial 0330 330 0330 (Option 2) to set up a new conference.
= Is my conference call time limited? =
No, there is no time limit to a conference call in progress and because the call is charged at geographic rates you will be paying much less for your call than with 08 conference services - so you can chat for much longer!
= Is the 03TALK service secure? =
You are allocated a random eight digit Conference Room Number and a four digit Access PIN giving a trillion permutations.
= Does 03TALK offer international access? =
Yes, you can invite people outside the UK to your 03TALK conference. Should they experience problems calling 0330 330 0330 from overseas, please ask them to use our international access number (44 12345 52 330).
[Please note, this number will not work for calls originating in the UK and offers no cost saving over the 03 access number for UK callers - even from mobiles.]
